##DeSkin Chrome Extension

###What is this?
This Chrome Extension hides Vevo ads from around Youtube music videos. Here's a blog describing how and why it was made: [http://www.bitfalls.com/2012/11/deskin-hide-vevo-ads-from-youtube.html](http://www.bitfalls.com/2012/11/deskin-hide-vevo-ads-from-youtube.html)

###Is it published on the Chrome Web Store?
Yeah, [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/deskin/gjfcomekfmcfgeggbconlaaojjchiccg) but VEVO and Youtube might take it down soon, so I don't guarantee that link works whenever you're reading this. If it's dead, you can always download and install it manually.

###Licensing and terms of use
Read LICENSE for general stuff. I'm not responsible for anything that happens to you, your loved ones, or your computer by using this extension. Installing and using it is purely your own responsibility, and if Vevo sues you for closing your eyes at their hideous ads, I can't do anything about it.
